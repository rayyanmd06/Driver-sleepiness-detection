# 🚗💤 **Driver Sleepiness Detection Using Alertness System**  
### 🧠 *A Research-Driven Safety Project | 2024–2025 | Jain (Deemed-to-be) University*

---

## 🔍 Overview  
Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents worldwide.  
In this **major capstone project**, we designed and built a **real-time AI-powered drowsiness detection system** that detects driver sleepiness using **facial landmark analysis** and issues instant alerts — potentially saving lives.  

The system integrates **computer vision** and **3D simulation** to test driver alertness in a safe, realistic virtual environment.

## 🚨 Detection Highlights  
- 🎯 **AI-Powered Eye Tracking** – Used **Google MediaPipe Face Mesh** and **OpenCV (Python)** to compute the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**.  
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Alert System** – Triggered alarm using **Pygame** when EAR dropped below a threshold, signaling **microsleeps**.  
- ⚙️ **Performance** – Achieved **>90% detection accuracy** across varied lighting conditions and driver postures.  
- ⚡ **Low Latency** – Alarm response time of **<500 ms** for immediate driver feedback.

## 🎮 Immersive Unity Simulation  
To ensure safe testing and realistic validation, we built a **custom 3D driving simulator** using **Unity 3D**:

- 🕹️ Simulated **realistic vehicle controls** — steering, acceleration, and braking via **C# scripts**.  
- 🌐 Enabled **live socket communication** between **Python and Unity** using **TCP/IP**.  
- 💻 Visualized **live driver alerts and dashboard warnings** inside the virtual car environment.  
- 🧩 Tested **real and simulated fatigue** scenarios for accurate system evaluation.
