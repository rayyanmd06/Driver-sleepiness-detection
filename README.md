🚗💤 Driver Sleepiness Detection Using Alertness System | AI + Computer Vision + Unity Simulation
 🧠 A Research-Driven Safety Project | 2024–2025 | Jain (Deemed-to-be) University
🔍 Overview:
 In this major capstone project, we designed and built a real-time drowsiness detection system to combat one of the leading causes of road accidents: driver fatigue. Leveraging AI-driven facial landmark analysis and integrating it with a 3D simulation environment, our system not only detects signs of drowsiness but actively alerts the driver — potentially saving lives.
🚨 Detection Highlights:
Used Google MediaPipe's Face Mesh and OpenCV in Python to track eye aspect ratio (EAR).
Triggered real-time alerts using Pygame when EAR drops below threshold — indicating possible microsleeps.
Achieved >90% detection accuracy in varied lighting and driver postures with sub-500ms alarm response.
🎮 Immersive Simulation:
 To test the system safely and thoroughly, we created a custom 3D driving simulator in Unity:
Simulated realistic vehicle control (steering, acceleration, braking) using C# scripts.
Enabled live communication between Python and Unity via TCP sockets.
Tested real and simulated fatigue in a virtual environment — showcasing live alerts and dashboard warnings.
🔗 Tech Stack:
 Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe | Unity 3D | C# | Pygame | Socket Programming | TCP/IP
📊 Research-Backed Approach:
Reviewed 10+ research papers spanning traditional ML, CNN ensembles, and EEG-based detection.
Positioned our method against state-of-the-art techniques with superior modularity and real-world simulation.
Designed to be affordable, extensible, and platform-independent.
🎯 Outcome:
 Our system delivers an end-to-end prototype that:
Detects drowsiness with high accuracy in real time.
Offers a robust testing platform for future research in autonomous safety.
Lays the groundwork for embedded AI systems in real-world vehicles.
🛠️ Future Enhancements:
Head pose and heart rate monitoring integration.
Dynamic traffic scenarios and embedded deployment (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
Usability testing with real drivers to calibrate thresholds.

🔗 Proud to have worked on a project that combines computer vision, simulation, and real-world safety applications. Looking forward to applying these skills in cutting-edge AI and autonomous systems.
