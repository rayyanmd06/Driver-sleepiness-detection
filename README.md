# Driver Drowsiness Detection and Unity Game Integration

This project presents a real-time driver drowsiness detection system built using Python (OpenCV) and integrated with a Unity game engine. The system detects fatigue-related behavior (eye closure, yawning) through facial landmark analysis and simulates in-game consequences such as blurry vision, slowed controls, and blackouts.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
- Integration of Python detection module with Unity via Flask API or socket communication
- Game-based simulation of drowsy driving effects (blur, delay, micro-sleeps)
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Potential for use in driver education, awareness campaigns, and training simulators

### ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
- Python, Mediapipe, Dlib (for face detection and landmark tracking)
- Unity 3D (for simulation and response)
- Flask / Sockets (for communication)
- Machine Learning (optional for advanced classification)
